 * Make bundled assets (images, fonts) load in Expo Go behind the Bilt preview proxy.
 *
 * The proxy deletes `extra.expoGo.developer` from the manifest, because Expo Go on a
 * physical iPhone refuses a dev-server manifest that keeps it. expo-asset reads that
 * same field to decide whether to build dev-server asset URLs; without it every
 * `require()`d asset resolves to the published-update CDN instead, where a dev asset
 * was never uploaded, and loads forever.
 *
 * Rewriting each asset's `httpServerLocation` to an absolute URL takes priority over
 * that branch (see expo-asset's `selectAssetSource`). The origin comes from the bundle
 * URL rather than `debuggerHost` so it keeps the proxy's `/<share-token>/` path prefix,
 * which a host-only value would drop.
